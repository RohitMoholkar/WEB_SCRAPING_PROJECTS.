## I have included Web Scraping from Infinite-scrolling Websites, Multipage Websites, Dynamic Content Projects using Python in this Repository. 

### About Web Scraping:
Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites, to gather and analyze information for various purposes. It involves parsing the HTML or other markup language of web pages to retrieve specific data elements such as text, images, links, and more. Projects utilize Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, Requests, Selenium to efficiently extract structured data, enabling comprehensive analysis and insights from diverse online sources. Simplify the extraction process for dynamic content, seamlessly navigate through multiple pages, and tackle the challenges of scraping data from sites with infinite scrolling mechanisms. Unlocking the potential of web scraping for data-driven projects. 

### About Python Requests Library:  
The requests library used to send HTTP requests and handle the corresponding responses, makes it easier for data engineer/developers to interact with web services and retrieve data from URLs.

Beautiful Soup is a python library designed for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It provides a convenient way to navigate, search, and modify the hierarchical structure of a source code, making it easier to scrape and extract information from web pages. 

### About Python Selenium Library: 
The selenium library is used to extract data from dynamic web pages, it can execute javascript and dynamically load content, also to scrape data from infinite scroll web pages selenium is very useful.
